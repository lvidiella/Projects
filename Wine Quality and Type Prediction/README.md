## Describe here your project


With this project we are analyzing a wine database. The database collects information for red and white wine, separately. In some instances, we combined both (red and white) into one dataset. Here are the input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

   1 - fixed acidity
   2 - volatile acidity
   3 - citric acid
   4 - residual sugar
   5 - chlorides
   6 - free sulfur dioxide
   7 - total sulfur dioxide
   8 - density
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates
   11 - alcohol
   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

With Binary Classification we want to see if we can predict the quality of wine. To do this, we created a new column called 'tasty' giving 1 to wines equal or better than 7, and 0 for the rest. We use Binary Classification using all the input variables (but quality) in our vector to predict the target: tasty. We do this for red wine, white wine and combined. We use Logistic classification, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient-Boosted tree Classifier to see which one has a better prediction. 

Scripts:
- LogisticRegressionRed.py
- LogisticRegerssionWhite.py
- LogisticRegressionCombinedQuality.py

We also use Binary Classification to see if we can predict if a wine is red or white, with the same Binary Classificators mentioned above. 

Script:
- LogisticRegressionRedOrWhite.py

Finally, we use Linear Regression to see if we can predict the variable 'quality' using regression models. We use Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted Tree to se which one had the best RMSE and, therefore, prediction. 

Script:
- RegressionRed.py
- RegressionWhite.py
- RegressionCombined.py

Conclusions:
- Binary Classification gives is an area under roc of 1 for almost all cases but the combined one. The reason for this, most certainly, is because the datasets separated (white, red, and combined) are too small and, hence, it gives us a very accurate result. Another reason to believe this is because many specialists support that 'quality' is a variable that depends a lot on the human factor as there is no 'ideal' combination of variables that make a good wine from a bad wine. 

- Binary Classification for either determining if it's a red or white wine gives low area under ROC. These results were a little bit surprising as there are some traits that are characteristic from red wine and some from white wine. For instance, low pH is characteristic from white wines, as their acidity tends to be higher and viceversa. Hence, the reason for getting this results is that the model probably takes too many variables that are not relevant to the type of wine, and this should have been tackled analyzing the correlation between the variables. 

- Linear Regression for quality was never very accurate either, and the reason for this is most certainly the same as the reason for the Binary Classification. Also, the correlation between quality and the rest of the variables is very low for all types of wines, and of course combined dataset. Some of the variables that had a higher correlation were alcohol (between 43% and 49%), volatile acidity (-39% for red wine), density (around 30% for white wine), sulphates (25% for red). The rest had correlations below 25%. Hence, we cannot explain the resutls or behavior of the target variable (quality) with most of the other variables. 

# How to run  

Run every script from the 'Code' folder separately, or directly from the main folder. Both contain the same, GitHub would not let me delete the folder or the files inside. Each script is analysing a different wine (or combined) with either Linear Regression or Binary Classification, depending on what is it that we are looking for. 

Discussion of results (and graphs with beta coefficients) are found in the PDF file called 'CS 777 â€“ Final Project Report'. In addition to the results, there is also some introduction/explanation to wine and its variables. However, this file also gives a good summary of what the PDF reads.
